# Phase 12 — results

Branch: `phase12`. This is a **cumulative** results document; each section names
its commit under test and links its sealed receipt. Everything here was measured
in the pinned Docker services; nothing ran on the host.

## Cross-document reuse (12.8)

Subphase 12.8 asks for genuine, honestly scoped cross-document procedural state
under exact content identity (ADR-0034): same bytes → same content id → one
stored blob/node, scored as **work** and as a **representation fact**, never as a
byte fraction.

**Receipt:** `evidence/campaigns/2026-10-06-phase12-share-e7ef693/`
(`SUMMARY.md`, `commands.txt`, `environment.json`, `raw/` incl. `metrics.json`),
produced by `tools/phase12-share-court.sh` in the pinned `dev` service over a
**randomized** cohort (resource bytes read from `/dev/urandom`; seed recorded in
`raw/metrics.json`). Court driver: `examples/phase12_share_court.rs`.

### What is genuinely shared

* A byte-identical resource embedded in a **DOCX** and an **EPUB** resolves to
  **one** `ResourceBlob` content id (verified `contains_node`), i.e. one stored
  blob and one decoded member, with no second keying scheme. The randomized
  shared blob id is recorded in `raw/metrics.json`.
* The second document writes **0 bytes** for the shared blob — a representation
  fact, reported as `nodes_id_shared` and kept distinct from work reuse
  (`nodes_reused`).
* Work reuse is receipted: the observed `retained_inverse_work_fraction` was
  **0.3399** for the sharing EPUB (cold `4` node executions / `12217` cold input
  bytes → warm `2` / `8065`), computed from node executions + cold input bytes,
  never from source size.
* Exactness holds for every root in the receipt:
  `materialize_exact(root) == source` (length **and** SHA-256 **and** byte
  identity) for the DOCX, the sharing EPUB, and the control EPUB.

### What is *not* shared (recorded, not hidden)

* The Phase-11 **PDF** adapter extracts **no** embedded resource blob, so
  PDF↔DOCX resource sharing does not exist in this architecture. The court and
  the 12.8 integration court assert the reported `resource_blob_nodes == 0` for
  a PDF embedding the same bytes; a genuine cross-format share is demonstrated
  **DOCX↔EPUB** instead.
* Raw DEFLATE members and per-source span records are **not** content identity
  and are never claimed as sharing.
* The no-sharing control (a structurally identical EPUB embedding different
  bytes in a fresh store) shares no resource, shares no node id, and
  deduplicates zero bytes.

### Honest scope

`seed_bytes_saved_on_second_document` (measured `4258` bytes: the blob + decoded
seed-node records not rewritten) is a **seed-node record** fact, **not** an
overall store-size saving: each document's exact source descriptor is stored
independently and still contains the resource bytes. A shared blob pays its own
byte cost for the first document and is scored as state/work, so **no
compression claim** is made. This is the modest, real reuse the landed
architecture supports; it is recorded as measured, not manufactured.
